# epipolar-geometry
Calculation of Epipolar geometry using Fundamental Matrix, and the plotting the epipolar lines in the respective images. 

pointsFor4a contains the required data for the script to run. This can be taken by running the script but it just reduces the effort. 

the images: tr.jpg and orig.jpg were taken to understand the epipolar geometry of the setup. 

The report contains detailed explanation of the code and the achieved results.
